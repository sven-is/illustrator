<h1>sven.is/illustrator - Adobe Illustrator I, II, III</h1>
<h2>Instructor - Sven Is&aring;fall</h2>

<p>
Welcome to my online guide to Adobe Illustrator.  My name is Sven Is&aring;fall, or <tt>sven.is</tt> for short, and if you're reading this page, you're probably one of my illustrator students.  It is my hope that these lessons will flesh out what we go over in class, and provide a refresher for some of the techniques we'll explore.  Whether you are taking Illustrator I, II, or III, there will be something for you here.

<p>
Remember, Illustrator is only as powerful as your own understanding.  Believe in yourself, and trust me, you can draw anything!
