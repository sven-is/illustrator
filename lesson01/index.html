<h1>Illustrator I - Lesson One - The Pen Tool</h1>

<p>
When you're first starting out in any drawing tool, one problem quickly presents itself.  How my I make a mark on this page, and what can I do with it?  There are many ways in Illustrator to answer both queries, though to address both with the maximum of efficiency, there is no better way than the judicious application of the <i>pen tool</i>.
</p>

<p>
Even as the possibilities present in Illustrator manifest themselves and dazzle you, even as you fear you have reached your Elsinore and are going mad among its menus, modes, and multiples, you can always return to the one stalwart, humble pen. Make the grandest of gestures, or most delicate; or, affix your finishing touch.
