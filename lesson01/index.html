<h1>Illustrator I - Lesson One - The Pen Tool</h1>

<p>
When you're first starting out in any drawing tool, one problem quickly presents itself.  How may I make a mark on this page, and what can I do with it?  There are many ways in Illustrator to answer both queries.  To address both with the maximum of efficiency, there is no better way than the judicious application of the <i>pen tool</i>.
</p>

<p>
Even as the possibilities present in Illustrator manifest themselves and dazzle you, even as you fear you have reached your Elsinore and are going mad among its menus, modes, and multiples, you can always return to the stalwart, humble pen tool. Make the grandest of gestures, or most delicate; or, affix your finishing touch.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: A Blank Slate</h2>

<p>
We're going to get started with a familiar sight:  A blank canvas.  We have all been there, deadlines mounting, that same white square staring us in the face.  Well, don't worry, there are no deadlines in this class (at least not yet). If a blank canvas leaves you worried you have nothing to say, well then, hang on tight, because we're about to break the silence.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: The Right Tool</h2>

<p>
When you're ready, use your mouse to move the cursor to the lefthand side of the screen, and find the toolbar.  Assuming your Illustrator panels are in proper position, it should be locked to the left side of the screen.  (If not, go to the Tools menu and click "Reset to initial defaults", or "tilbakestilles til standardinnstillingene" as the case may be.)
</p>

<p>
Now find the pen tool in this list.  It should be the fifth one down.  If you're having trouble, it's the one that looks like a pencil.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Making Your Mark</h2>

<p>
Are you drawing yet?  If you haven't yet, click the pen icon and get ready, you're about to make your first illustration!  Our illustration will be pretty simple.  Make a single line, and stop.
</p>

<p>
Why just one line?  Lines are actually very special in Illustrator, in that each one is unique.  What I mean by that is, lines are never fixed. They can always be moved, stretched, squished, warped and weirded out, even deleted.  A line in Illustrator is not just a line. Rather it is a suggestion of motion, a gesture which we use to guide the program in making our illustration.
</p>

<p>
If that doesn't sound like drawing to you, remember we are not just drawing - we are illustrating.  If you like, consider a conductor, standing in front of a big orchestra.  The conductor does not play an instrument - but through various motions, big and small, the conductor plays the orchestra.  Likewise you do not make dim doodles in Illustrator, but rather spin symphonies out of the smallest gestures.
</p>

<p>
Look at the line you have made.  It is your first, but it will not be your last.  In this course, we will draw over 1,000 lines together, each of them with their own qualities.  My advice to you?  Study them.  Each line has its own lesson to teach.  Just be careful when drawing lines...  Do not be surprised if they roar!
</p>

<h2>Step 4: A Different Stroke</h2>

<p>
When you're done laughing at my little joke (it also will not be the last!), ready your pen tool beacuse we're about to let loose.  That's right.  Go crazy.  If you drew one line before, draw many.  Many lines!  All the lines you can!  Fill the page!  (If you did not follow instructions earlier, and have multiple lines on your screen, please start over and perform step 3 <i>accurately</i>.)
</p>

<p>
Incredibly, each time you go to draw, Illustrator will make a new line for you, and another, and another.  Illustrator has a seemingly limitless supply of lines, each one determined by how you move your hand while holding down the button.  You can draw all day, and Illustrator will keep making new lines as fast as you can click and drag.  It may seem that Illustrator has an infinite number of lines, and it probably does.  I have done a lot of drawing of lines, and have never run out.
</p>

<p>
Draw until you feel ready to stop.  Perhaps you have already stopped, and are reading these instructions again; that's fine.  Now look at your drawing.  Seems like just a minute ago we were wondering what we were going to draw - indeed, if we were going to start drawing at all!  If you're ever stuck for ideas, remember, you can always start over with a blank canvas, pick up the pen tool, and draw a line you have never seen before.  Sometimes, that's all you need to get the ideas flowing.
</p>

<h2>Step 5: Beyond Brushes</h2>

<p>
You can make all sorts of lines in Illustrator.  In fact, in Illustrator I, we are going to mostly confine ourselves to the pen tool, which can produce a whole bestiary of lines.  Short lines, long lines, fat lines, skinny lines, straight lines, squiggly lines, elegant lines, random lines, sharp lines, round lines, wavy lines, spiky lines, flowing lines, stippled lines, dotted lines, dashed lines, divots, doodles and dimples.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully in learning to make these lines, you will learn also <i>when</i> to make these lines.  Once there was a man who got dressed in the dark, but he only had one outfit, so his clothes always matched.  But you have to admit, this must have been pretty boring!  Luckily in Illustrator we can have different lines for every day of the week, every minute of the day, every second we spend at work.  Life is sometimes tedious, but never boring, when you are an Illustrator.
</p>

<p>
You may be wondering, what are these different lines?  How can I make them?  Well, that is a topic for our next lesson!
</p>

<h3>Assignment #1</h3>

<p>
Familiarize yourself with the pen tool.  Make some lines, and take notes on what you think they mean.  5 lines minimum.  (Please use a new canvas for this assignment.)
